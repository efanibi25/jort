        <p>
          We are going to max out at 20% commission so anything above $2500.00
          is going to be charged the 20% commission fee. I think that is fair
          for all partyâ€™s to be considered. Now as mentioned in the terms this
          will be part of the terms as well. The commission will be taken out
          before any bank and shipping fees are taken out.
